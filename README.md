This is the implementation of the paper on **Single View Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior [1]**. <br />
The program uses a **guided filter[2]** for a real time enhancement procedure. <br />
This was implemented as a part of the course **COL780** on **Computer Vision** during **July - November 2017**. <br />
